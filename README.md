# Neural-Network-from-Scratch--Hand-written-Digits-classifier
This is my first Deep Learning project, which is a MNIST hand-written digits classifier. The model is implemented completely from scratch WITHOUT using any prebuilt optimization like Tensorflow or Pytorch. Tensorflow is imported only to load the MNIST data set. The weights and biases are initialized by He et. al (2015) initialization. This model also uses 2 hidden layers with Adaptive Moment Optimization (Adam) and Drop-out regularization.
