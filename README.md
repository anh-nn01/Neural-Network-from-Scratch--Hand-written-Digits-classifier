# Neural-Network-from-Scratch--Hand-written-Digits-classifier
This is my first Deep Learning project, which is a MNIST hand-written digits classifier. The model is implemented completely from scratch WITHOUT using any prebuilt optimization library like Tensorflow or Pytorch. Tensorflow is imported only to load the MNIST data set. This model is a fully connected model with 2 hidden layers (it should be called Shallow Neural Network lol) and has a 95.08% accuracy on the test set. The hyperparameters were not tuned very well; therefore, with better tuned hyperparameters, this model can be improved to reach at least 97% accuracy on the test set. The optimization algorithm is Adaptive Moment Optimization (Adam). Drop-out regularization is also used to avoid overfitting.
